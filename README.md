## Project Overview:
The data in this dataset has been collected from a restaurant over time. Each entry represents a unique transaction, capturing details about the bill amount, tip given, the gender of the person paying, smoking preference, day of the week, time of day, and the size of the dining party. This dataset can be used to analyze tipping behavior and understand the factors that influence the amount of tip given. 

## Data Source:

the primary dataset used for this analysis was the Restaurant Tips data, containing detailed information about each activity made by the restaurant and was extracted from the company’s database using SQL codes.
SQL queries were written to the restaurant database to extract the required data for this project analysis.

## 	Data Analysis Tools used :
-	SQL (PostgreSQL) – for data collection, Data cleaning, Data Analysis
-	Power BI- for  Data Modelling, Visualization, and interactive Report creation.

## Data Collection : 
-	Database Inspection: I inspected the restaurant database using SQL Code to check for (null) in each of the tables.
-	I extracted the required data for the analysis using SQL queries.
